# Telegram Raspberry Info Project
## Introduction

Welcome to my Raspberry Pi Telegram Info Notifier project! ðŸš€ 

In this project, I've created a script that collects information about your Raspberry Pi and sends it to your Telegram chat. 

This can be useful for monitoring changes in your Raspberry Pi's hardware, such as the serial number, SD card details, and network interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

-   Raspberry Pi running a Debian-based operating system
-   Telegram account and a bot created using BotFather
-   Telegram chat ID (you can use get_id_bot to obtain it)
-   Basic knowledge of the Linux command line

## Step 1: Download the Telegram Raspberry Info Script
Download the script to a specified directory

`wget -O /path/to/download/directory/Raspberry-Pi-Telegram-Info-Notifier.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyrtopoulos/Linux/main/Scripts/Raspberry-Pi-Telegram-Info-Notifier/Raspberry-Pi-Telegram-Info-Notifier.sh`

### Step 2: Customize the Script
Open the downloaded script in a text editor to customize configuration variables.

`nano telegram-raspberry-info.sh` 

### Step 3: Make Script Executable

`chmod +x telegram-raspberry-info.sh` 

### Step 4: Edit Cron Jobs

`sudo crontab -e` 

### Step 5: Add Cron Job
Add the following line to run the script daily at 11:00 AM:

`0 11 * * * /path/to/telegram-raspberry-info.sh` 

Replace `/path/to/telegram-raspberry-info.sh` with the actual path.

### Step 6: Restart Cron Service
Restart the cron service to apply the changes.

`sudo systemctl restart cron` 


Now, the script will run daily, collecting Raspberry Pi information and sending it to your Telegram chat. Check the log file for initial and updated records.

Feel free to explore and modify the script according to your preferences or add more functionalities! 
If you have any suggestions or improvements, let me know. 
Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”§
